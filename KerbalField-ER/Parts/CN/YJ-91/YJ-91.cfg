description = "Eagle strike - 91" is called for "tailored" the bane of the aegis system. "The eagle strike - 91" is divided into two models, anti-radiation and anti-ship head structure vary with missile model is different. The radiant head is equipped with passive radar seeker and destruction blasting warheads, anti-ship type head is equipped with active radar seeker and half a warhead. Integrated the information to speculate that "eagle strike - 91" long and 4.7 meters, diameter of 360 mm, weighing 0.6 tons, the warheads weighing 90 kilograms, maximum range of 50 kilometers, the minimum range 5 kilometers.
