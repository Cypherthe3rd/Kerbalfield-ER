description = Phased array radar is passive or active electronically scanned array radar electronically scanned array radar, refers to a kind of by changing the surface of the antenna array beam made by way of synthesis, to change the direction of radar beam scanning. This design is different from the mechanical scan radar antenna, can reduce or completely avoid the use of mechanical motor drive radar antenna can achieve the purpose of covering large detection range.
